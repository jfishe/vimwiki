<ul>
<li>
Sisal rope 3/8 inch
  100 feet of 1/4 inch rope will wrap a 4x4 (standard lumber dimensions--i.e.,
  3.75 inches on a side) that is 20 inches long. Most cat poles range from 18
  to 20 inches per pole. Presumably 60 feet of 3/8 inch rope will also work.

<li>
Steel coat hanger to pull end of rope back through wrapped rope. Steel coat hangers with cardboard
  bottoms work best because the hanger already has a tight u-bend.
  Disassemble and bend into a tight U-shape, creating a giant needle to pull
  the rope back through the wrapped rope-stack, on the finished pole. You may
  need to spread the u-bend with a flat bladed screw driver to thread the sisal
  rope.
  Bend the u-bend's end so that it protrudes horizontally from the rest of the
  coat hanger--i.e., 90Â°. The protruding part should be approximately one inch
  to thread the rope when the coat hanger is tightly wrapped to the pole.

<li>
Leather work gloves unless you have tough hands

<li>
Pliers to pull staples and pull sisal rope through the coat
  hanger's u-bend.
  Vice-grips work best for pulling the coat hanger,
  needle-nose pliers best for threading the coat hanger.

<li>
Hammer to pull nails and counter sink structural nails and staples.

<li>
Scissors and/or box cutter to remove old carpet or rope and to trim new rope.

<li>
Large, one-handed, quick release clamp to hold rope in place when you let go.

</ul>
<div id="Cat Scratching Pole Sisal Rope Replacement-Instructions"><h2 id="Instructions" class="header"><a href="#Cat Scratching Pole Sisal Rope Replacement-Instructions">Instructions</a></h2></div>

<ol>
<li>
Place one end of rope at bottom of pole and extend rope until it reaches the top

<li>
Form a loop and cinch tight. The dangling rope should be under the loop or
   tie with half-hitch.

<li>
Thread to bottom end of the rope through the coat hanger and clamp the coat
   hanger at the bottom. Ensure at least one inch of coat hanger protrudes away
   from the pole. The coat hanger will hold the rope in place while you wrap
   the pole.

<li>
Wrap the remaining rope around pole, pulling upwards to tighten the rope-stack.

<li>
Continue wrapping until you reach the top of the coat hanger. Make sure the
   end remains exposed, so you can pull it out at the end.

<li>
If you need a break, move the clamp to hold the rope tightly in place.

<li>
Remove the bottom rope from the coat hanger: it remains at the bottom; the
   coat hanger just held it in place while you started wrapping.

<li>
If you run out of rope, clamp the rope to hold the rope-stack tight.

<ol>
<li>
You may need to re-position the coat hanger so you can pull the rope
     through six to twelve inches of the rope-stack.

<li>
Thread the coat hanger with the last 1-1/2 inches of the final 12 inches
     of the existing rope and the beginning of a new roll of rope. Use
     needle-nose pliers to thread the rope.

<li>
Pull both ropes back through the rope stack. Ensure the rope is tight.

<li>
Re-position the coat hanger at the bottom of the pole and continue wrapping.

</ol>
<li>
When you reach the bottom of the pole, clamp the end to hold it in place.

<ol>
<li>
Leave roughly 12 inches of rope to pull back through with the coat hanger.

<li>
Use needle-nose pliers to thread 1-1/2 inches of the rope through the coat hanger.

<li>
Pull the rope back through the rope stack. Ensure the rope is tight.

</ol>
<li>
Trim the ends of the rope(s) so they are covered by the rope stack.

<li>
Invite your kitties to test your handiwork.

<div id="Cat Scratching Pole Sisal Rope Replacement-Lessons Learned"><h2 id="Lessons Learned" class="header"><a href="#Cat Scratching Pole Sisal Rope Replacement-Lessons Learned">Lessons Learned</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Counter sink any structural nails or staples, such as those pinning the pole
  together. Many poles use 2x4 lumber stapled together to make a 4x4. Exposed
  nails and staples can injure cats' paws.

<li>
Wrap the coat hanger in the rope-stack, rather than trying to thread it
  through afterwards.

<li>
Use the coat hanger to hold the loose end of the rope during wrapping. This
  helps with tension in the rope and keeps the loose end in place.

<li>
Remove carpet from the pole if practical. The rope is easier to wrap without
  having to maintain tension against the carpet. Sliding rope up to maintain a
  tight rope-stack is also easier without the added friction of the carpet.

<li>
Most instructions recommend 3/8 inch sisal rope. 1/4 inch also works but
  requires greater lengths.
