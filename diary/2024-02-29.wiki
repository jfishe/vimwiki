*Directions*:

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F/220°C.

4. Place cut side down on the baking sheet.
5. Add vegetables to a large bowl.
6. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle the seasonings over the top.
7. Mix everything together until the veggies are well coated.
8. Spread vegetables on top of baking racks.
9. Place in the middle of the oven and roast for 30-35 minutes until the edges
   are crispy and vegetables are fork tender.
10. Set aside to cool.
11. Squeeze garlic from bulb onto vegetables.
12. Heat the oil and butter in a pan, over medium heat, and brown the beef.
13. Remove the beef from the pan.
14. Sauté onions until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
15. Add tomato paste, paprika, and red chili flakes to the onion mixture and cook another minute.
16. Add oregano, canned tomatoes, parmesan, beer, beef broth, and Worcestershire sauce.

22. If the liquid level gets too low, add more broth as needed.
23. Adjust seasoning as needed.
24. If the stew is too thin, remove a cup of cooking liquid from the
    pan and stir in the flour. Add the flour mixture back into the pan and
    stir. Simmer for 10 minutes until the stew is thick.
25. The meat should be very tender; if it's tough, let it continue to cook.
