  {{{toml
  [core]
  # When set to true, level 1 headings will be treated as document titles
  # (this includes an assumption of having a single title in the document).
  # Setting this to false automatically changes the default wiki link
  # completion style to a file-based one.
  title_from_heading = false

  # Use incremental resolution of project-wide references.
  # This is much more efficient but is currently experimental
  incremental_references = true

  [completion]
  # The style of wiki links completion.
  # Other values include:
  # * "file-stem" to complete using file name without an extension,
  # * "file-path-stem" same as above but using file path.
  wiki.style = "file-path-stem"
