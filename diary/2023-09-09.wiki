- `%autosave 0` causes `Javascript Error: IPython is not defined Autosave
  disabled`. `Jupytext` works without.
- `<C-S-C>` opens the Command Palette. `Reload Notebook from Disk` refreshes
  Jupyter Lab.

- Jupyter heading anchors are not consistent with Myst:
  - Myst heading_anchors are lower case. Punctuation is dropped and spaces
    replaced with hyphens.
  - Jupyter matches the heading literally, replacing spaces with hyphens.
  - Simplest solution is using fixed anchors or breaking the linking in
    Jupyter.
