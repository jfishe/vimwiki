# Blending High Extraction and Low Extraction Flours

The [Tartine method][Tartine3] calls for wheat flours at various extraction levels which
are not easy to purchase. They can, however, be created by blending low and
high extraction flour. The
[Hamelman Challenge, Tech. Note: High Extraction Flour][Hamelman Challenge]
provides a method for blending whole wheat (100% extraction) and typical bread
flour (~70% extraction) to achieve the desired High Extraction Flour (85%).
