recommends repairing the Windows Update database, which may need to be run
several times until no errors are found:

  * Open Windows `Powershell (Admin)`:

  {{{ class="PowerShell"
  cd $env:windir\diagnostics\system\windowsupdate\
  Get-TroubleshootingPack  .  |  Invoke-TroubleshootingPack  -Result  $env:TEMP
  }}}

  * Open `cmd.exe` with admin. rights:

  {{{ class="DOSBATCH"
  net stop wuauserv
  del /f /s /q C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\*.*
  del /f /s /q C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\*.*
  net start wuauserv
  wuauclt /detectnow /reportnow
  }}}


== NumLock on Startup ==
    1. On the Logon/Lock screen, press the NumLock key on the keyboard to turn it on.
    2. The Login screen contains a power button in the bottom right corner. Use
       it to reboot Windows.
    3. If that does not work:
        1. Win-R regedit
        2. `HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard`
        3. Default InitialKeyboardIndicators should be `2147483658` (`0x8000000A`).
        4. Set InitialKeyboardIndicators to `2147483650` i.e., `0x80000002` if Windows
           does not save NumLock status after reboot.
        5. `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard` does the following:
           | InitialKeyboardIndicators value | Purpose                                                 |
           |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
           | 0                               | Turn all indicators off (NumLock, CapsLock, ScrollLock) |
           | 1                               | Turn CapsLock on                                        |
           | 2                               | Turn NumLock on                                         |
           | 3                               | Turn CapsLock and NumLock on                            |
           | 4                               | Turn ScrollLock on                                      |
           | 5                               | Turn CapsLock and ScrollLock on                         |
           | 6                               | Turn NumLock and ScrollLock on                          |
           | 7                               | Turn all indicators on (NumLock, CapsLock, ScrollLock)  |

== Explorer Quick Access ==
There are situations where nothing would work and invalid pinned shortcut in
Quick access get stuck and not removable. According to [[http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/fix-quick-access-reset-pinned-shortcuts-stuck-not-working-windows-10/|winhelponline]],
deleting the following file will reset the Quick Access menu to its default
pinned folders.

  {{{ class="DOSBATCH"
  cmd.exe /c del "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations\f01b4d95cf55d32a.automaticDestinations-ms"
  }}}

== Chocolatey ==
[[https://chocolatey.org/|Chocolatey]] can serve as a package manager for Windows. The package
[[https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup|choco-package-list-backup]] creates the packages.config file after
configuring where to save the backup by editing variables
in [[file:C:/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/choco-package-list-backup.ps1|choco-package-list-backup.ps1]] to select a backup location.
If any --params were passed to choco install, these need to be manually added
(note the script overwrites the file without prompting, so save to a different
location).  https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsInstall describes the packageParameters
key that would need to be added to packages.config to replicate the previous
installation.
