My attempt at Tucson's [[https://www.cafepassetucson.com/|Cafe Passe]] Meso
Mocha with some changes to avoid ingredients that do not store well for weeks.
The original uses chocolate syrup, which does not keep long enough to make at
home.  The peppers are stronger than the original. The sugar is 3 Tbs:4 Tbs
cocoa powder; most recipes have a 1:1 or higher ratio.

Yield: 2 × 16 oz

1. Add dry ingredients to a mixing bowl.
  1. 36 g sugar
  2. 30 g Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/natural-cocoa-powder/c-24/p-913/pd-s|Natural High Fat Cocoa Powder]]
  3. 1/4 tsp Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/chipotle-pepper-ground-red/c-24/p-866/pd-s|Chipotle Pepper Ground Red]]
  4. 1/4 tsp Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/black-and-red-spice/c-24/p-25/pd-s|Black and Red Spice]]
  5. 1/4 heaping tsp Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/vietnamese-cinnamon-ground/c-24/p-955/pd-s|Vietnamese Cinnamon Ground]]
2. Whisk dry ingredients to reduce clumps.
3. Add 2 shots (2 oz) of hot espresso and whisk until paste is smooth,
   scrapping down sides of the bowl.
4. Whisk in additional espresso shot(s) to taste, typically 2 – 4.
  1. If one drink should be stronger, reserve additional espresso shot(s) in
     the refrigerator or freezer.
5. Allows flavors to merge, in the bowl, at room temperature, i.e.,
   5 – 10 minutes on the counter top.
6. Add enough half-cream to bring mix to approximately 16 oz, i.e., ~12 oz.
7. Divide equally between two, 16 oz, tumbler cups.
8. Add chilled, reserved espresso.
9. Fill cups with ice.
10. Top up with half-cream and stir until well mixed.
