== Iced Meso Mocha Breve ==

My attempt at Tucson's [[https://www.cafepassetucson.com/|Cafe Passe]] Meso
Mocha with some changes to avoid ingredients that do not store well for weeks.
The original uses chocolate syrup, which does not keep long enough to make at
home.  The peppers are stronger than the original (1 g is roughly a large
pinch; adjust to taste). The sugar is 3 Tbs:4 Tbs cocoa powder; most recipes
have a 1:1 or higher ratio.

1. Weigh dry ingredients into a mixing bowl.
  1. 36 g sugar
  2. 30 g Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/natural-cocoa-powder/c-24/p-913/pd-s|Natural High Fat Cocoa Powder]]
  3. 1 g each:

2. Add enough half-cream to make a thin paste, approximately 2 Tbs.
3. Whisk until paste is smooth, scrapping down sides of the bowl. Add more cream
   if the paste collects inside the whisk.
4. Add enough half-cream to bring mix to approximately 16 oz.
5. Divide equally between two 16 oz tumbler cups.
6. Add 1 – 4 shots chilled espresso (1 – 4 oz).
7. Fill cups with ice.
8. Top with half-cream and stir until well mixed.
