== Sweet Home 3D ==

- Furniture, textures and licenses from v5.7.1 archived in
  [[C:/Users/fishe/Documents/SweetHome3D|Sweet Home 3D]]
- To load either copy to the appropriate directory in
  `%APPDATA%\eTeks\Sweet Home 3D` or double-click on individual files to
  import.

== Fonts ==

- Best looking but missing some unicode fonts:
  [[https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/|Adobe Monospaced font family for user interface and coding environments]]
- [[http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html|Large, multi-script Unicode fonts for Windows computers]]
- Most complete but not easy to read:
  [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/unifont|Unifont - Summary]]
- Explains how to use `fontforge`, which requires `X11 server`, such as
  `Xming`: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10290912/|How do I get GNU Unifont or Free Mono working on gvim windows?]]
- Built-in font `NSimSum` works within the WSL console and thus Vim.

== WiFi ==

- To get WiFi security key content, type
  `netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear`.
