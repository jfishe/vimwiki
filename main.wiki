== Computer ==

=== Sweet Home 3D ===

- Furniture, textures and licenses from v5.7.1 archived in
  [[file:C:/Users/fishe/Documents/SweetHome3D|Sweet Home 3D]]
- To load either copy to the appropriate directory in
  `%APPDATA%\eTeks\Sweet Home 3D` or double-click on individual files to
  import.

=== Fonts ===

- Best looking but missing some unicode fonts:
  [[https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/|Adobe Monospaced font family for user interface and coding environments]]
- [[http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html|Large, multi-script Unicode fonts for Windows computers]]
- Most complete but not easy to read:
  [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/unifont|Unifont - Summary]]
- Explains how to use `fontforge`, which requires `X11 server`, such as
  `X410`: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10290912/|How do I get GNU Unifont or Free Mono working on gvim windows?]]
- Built-in font `NSimSum` works within the WSL console and thus Vim.
- [[https://github.com/jfishe/dotfiles#fonts-for-gvim|Fonts for Gvim]] in the
  [[https://github.com/jfishe/dotfiles|dotfiles]] repository lists several nice fonts.

=== WiFi ===

- To get WiFi security key content, type
  `netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear`.

=== Motorola H17 Bluetooth Headset ===

=== French Press Coffee ===
:coffee:

[[https://youtu.be/st571DYYTR8|The Ultimate French Press Technique by James Hoffmann]]

1. Rinse empty press with 200 °F water and discard water after grinding coffee.
2. Add 30 g coffee (OXO Barista Brain 4 cups = 33 g), grind-stop 10 for OXO
   Barista Brain.
3. Add 500 g, 200 °F water.
4. Steep 4 minutes or [[https://youtu.be/Y8cbxTumzvg|wibble, wobble, double nipple]] per Mrs. Marlowe of Brokenwood.
5. Stir gently and skim coarse grounds and foam.
6. Steep at least 5 – 8 minutes.
7. Push plunger to top of liquid and pore gently.

=== Chicory Coffee ===
:chicory:

1. 500 ml, 200 °F water
2. 24 g ground chicory
3. 24 g ground coffee
4. Prepare per [[#French Press Coffee]].

=== Iced Meso Mocha Breve ===
:coffee:mocha:

My attempt at Tucson's [[https://www.cafepassetucson.com/|Cafe Passe]] Meso
Mocha with some changes to avoid ingredients that do not store well for weeks.
The original uses chocolate syrup, which does not keep long enough to make at
home.  The peppers are stronger than the original (1 g is roughly a large
pinch; adjust to taste). The sugar is 3 Tbs:4 Tbs cocoa powder; most recipes
have a 1:1 or higher ratio.

1. Weigh dry ingredients into a mixing bowl.
  1. 36 g sugar
  2. 30 g Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/natural-cocoa-powder/c-24/p-913/pd-s|Natural High Fat Cocoa Powder]]
  3. 1 g each:
    1. Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/chipotle-pepper-ground-red/c-24/p-866/pd-s|Chipotle Pepper Ground Red]]
    2. Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/black-and-red-spice/c-24/p-25/pd-s|Black and Red Spice]]
    3. Penseys Spices [[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/vietnamese-cinnamon-ground/c-24/p-955/pd-s|Vietnamese Cinnamon Ground]]
2. Add enough half-cream to make a thin paste, approximately 2 Tbs.
3. Whisk until paste is smooth, scrapping down sides of the bowl. Add more cream
   if the paste collects inside the whisk.
4. Add enough half-cream to bring mix to approximately 16 oz.
5. Divide equally between two 16 oz tumbler cups.
6. Add 1 – 4 shots chilled espresso (1 – 4 oz).
7. Fill cups with ice.
8. Top with half-cream and stir until well mixed.

=== Mignonette Pepper ===
:pepper:seasoning:

Most mignonette pepper recipes include all spice berries and only include white
and black peppercorns. This is based on the ground pepper available as
[[https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/mignonette-pepper/c-24/p-207/pd-s|Pensey's Mignonette Pepper]].


| Pepper    | g/Tb | g/Jar |
|-----------|-----:|------:|
| Coriander |    5 |    20 |
| Black     |   11 |    44 |
| White     |   13 |    52 |
| Szechuan  |    4 |    16 |
| Green     |    7 |    28 |

=== Santa Maria Rub ===
